# Daniel Willis's Linguistics research

## Walmajarri

I did my honours thesis on [Walmajarri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walmajarri_language), an Australian language from the Kimerley Region. I proposed a reanalysis of the language's clitic system using already published data and texts.

 - My honours thesis: [Not just any old auxiliary! *The semantics & pragmatics of Walmajarriâ€™s clitic system*](downloads/willis-thesis.pdf)
 - [The NLTK corpus I used when working on my thesis.](downloads/walmajarri-nltk-corpus.zip) It is very rough, but might be of interest to someone.
